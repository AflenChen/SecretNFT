# SecretNFT Project Summary

## Project Overview

SecretNFT is a confidential NFT launch platform built with FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine) technology. The project follows the architecture of Zama award-winning projects, implementing confidential NFT launch functionality to protect user purchase privacy and trading strategies.

## Core Features

### üîê Privacy Protection
- **Confidential Price Discovery**: NFT prices are completely encrypted on-chain, preventing price manipulation
- **Confidential Purchase Records**: User purchase amounts and payment amounts are encrypted and stored
- **Confidential Allocation Mechanism**: NFT allocation process remains confidential
- **User Behavior Protection**: Prevents other users from analyzing purchase patterns

### üöÄ Functional Features
- **Decentralized Launch**: Based on Ethereum blockchain, no need to trust third parties
- **Multi-Token Support**: Supports ETH and ERC20 token payments
- **Flexible Time Control**: Can set launch start and end times
- **Batch Minting**: Supports batch NFT minting functionality
